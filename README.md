# LLM Observability Demo

A demonstration repository showcasing best practices and techniques for observability in Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive demo for implementing observability in LLM-powered applications. It demonstrates monitoring, logging, tracing, and performance analysis techniques specifically tailored for AI/ML workloads involving Large Language Models.

## What is LLM Observability?

LLM Observability refers to the ability to understand, monitor, and debug Large Language Model applications in production. This includes:

- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times, token usage, and throughput
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor response quality, hallucination detection, and accuracy
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage, token consumption, and associated costs
- **Error Handling**: Capture and analyze failures, timeouts, and edge cases
- **User Experience**: Track user interactions, satisfaction, and usage patterns

## Features

- üîç **Comprehensive Monitoring**: End-to-end observability for LLM applications
- üìä **Performance Analytics**: Detailed metrics and dashboards
- üö® **Alerting System**: Proactive monitoring and notifications
- üìà **Cost Analysis**: Track and optimize LLM usage costs
- üîß **Debugging Tools**: Advanced troubleshooting capabilities
- üìù **Logging Standards**: Best practices for LLM application logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.8+
- Access to LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanmaclean/llm_observability_demo.git
cd llm_observability_demo

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your API keys and configuration:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   OBSERVABILITY_ENDPOINT=your_monitoring_endpoint
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```javascript
// Example implementation coming soon
import { LLMObservability } from './lib/observability';

const observer = new LLMObservability({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  monitoring: true,
  tracing: true
});

// Your LLM application code with observability
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Start the demo application
npm run demo
# or
python demo.py

# View the monitoring dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across microservices
2. **Structured Logging**: Consistent log formats for LLM operations
3. **Metrics Collection**: Custom metrics for LLM-specific KPIs
4. **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error handling and reporting
5. **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in LLM pipelines
6. **Security Monitoring**: Track sensitive data and access patterns
